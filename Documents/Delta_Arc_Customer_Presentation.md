## Understanding Your Challenge

### Current Data Pipeline
```
PostgreSQL ──→ S3 ──→ Snowflake ──→ Looker
    ✅         ❌         ✅           ✅
 Connected    GAP!    Connected   Connected
```

### Pain Points We're Solving

**🔍 Metadata Black Hole**
- S3 layer invisible to Atlan platform
- Broken lineage visibility
- Manual tracking of data flows

**⚠️ Governance Risk**
- No automated discovery of S3 assets
- Missing compliance audit trails
- Inability to track PII through intermediate storage

**⏱️ Operational Inefficiency**
- 4-6 hours to trace data lineage manually
- Data engineers spending time on metadata questions
- Business users blocked on data discovery

### What We're Building

**S3 Asset Integration**
- Register S3 bucket and objects as first-class Atlan assets
- Extract technical metadata (size, format, timestamps)
- Apply intelligent business context and classification

**End-to-End Lineage**
- PostgreSQL → S3 export processes
- S3 → Snowflake ingestion processes
- Column-level lineage where applicable

**Automated Governance**
- Real-time metadata updates
- PII and sensitive data classification
- Compliance audit trail generation

## Technical Deep Dive

### Component 1: S3 Asset Discovery
```python
# Intelligent S3 scanning and registration
✅ Scan bucket structure automatically
✅ Create S3Object assets for each data file
✅ Extract file metadata (size, format, modification time)
✅ Apply business tags based on naming patterns
```

### Component 2: Lineage Creation
```python
# Establish complete data flow visibility
✅ Map PostgreSQL tables → S3 objects
✅ Map S3 objects → Snowflake tables
✅ Create LineageProcess assets
✅ Enable impact analysis across pipeline
```

### Component 3: Automation Layer
```python
# Event-driven metadata management
✅ S3 event notifications for real-time updates
✅ Scheduled batch discovery for comprehensive scans
✅ Integration with existing ETL processes
```
