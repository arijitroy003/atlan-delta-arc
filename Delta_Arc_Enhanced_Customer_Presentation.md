## Understanding Your Critical Compliance Challenge

### Regulatory Landscape
```
🇸🇬 Singapore PDPA + 🇮🇩 Indonesia PP71 = ⚖️ Stringent Requirements

• Data breach notification: 72 hours
• Cross-border transfer restrictions
• Mandatory data protection officer
• Complete audit trail requirements
• Financial services security certification
```

### Current State: Critical Compliance Gaps
```
PostgreSQL ──→ S3 ──→ Snowflake ──→ Looker
    ✅            ❌         ✅           ✅
 Visible    BLIND SPOT   Visible     Visible

🚨 RISKS IDENTIFIED:
❌ No PII inventory across pipeline
❌ Missing CIA security classifications
❌ Broken audit trail through S3
❌ No business ownership accountability
❌ Manual access control = security risk
```

### Why This Matters NOW
- **Regulatory Penalties**: Up to $1M+ for PDPA violations
- **Audit Readiness**: Currently 2+ weeks preparation time
- **Security Incidents**: No visibility into PII data flow
- **Business Risk**: Cannot demonstrate compliance to regulators
